## Image to Text

This repository is a demo of how it is possible to generate strings from the charachters.
First a model is created from pictures of individual chars with a convolutional neural network.
Then using tesseract the a target image is broken up into individual chars and fed into the model. 

This notebook contains 
1. A notebook exploring the data used to generate the model.
2. A notebook showing how the model was created. 
3. A notebook showing how the model can be used to generate strings computers can interpret.
4. A full report describing all the details. 
5. A demo of how the tesseract library is used
